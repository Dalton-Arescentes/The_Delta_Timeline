So if I may, I shall begin
*she would do a small inhale*
So in the last world I was in, these monoliths appeared and with them a weird disease started to come around... like a perversion of nature... it twisted and corrupted it... some in the form of undead beasts though it worked through the land... sometimes the monsters retained the memories of their previous lives. I mostly traveled alone during that time, but I remember how things ended for most of the people I did travel with. When they were killed sometimes when they came back as undead, if they managed to retain their memories enough to function on that level again... the infection pulled them in though... forced them to make armor and weapons for its abominations

*she would take one of Barker's rums and take a swig from it as she stabs one of her daggers into the surface she's using*

It got to the point where the world at large was even willing to work with my version of Veterus and as our numbers dwindled in that world, as our numbers grew fewer and fewer and with it our hope, angels descended and it was the people who had died attempting to remove the spears skewering and plaguing our world. I know this because I was one of the people who was charged to fight against the monoliths, I was forced out of my retirement to do so

*her eyes would glow a deep red as she speaks, her dark cherubim wings being unfolded, but relaxed with a bit of red coloring from her Iqor*

Not many survived to be honest... I was lucky enough to be one of the ones who did and while the angels did succeed... overnight they had killed a lot more people, I managed to kill one of the angels and because of it I started to be called "The Angel Slayer" or something along those lines... by the time they left, by the time my fight against the heavens was finished... there were only a few thousand survivors left... the key difference between heaven and hell is that heaven is very over funded while hell is underfunded
