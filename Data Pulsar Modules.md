#Technology/Weaponry [[Zara]] 
The Absolute Cutting Edge of Technology, only Zara, Zaraha, and Zakai understand how it works, standard assembly & reverse engineering has proven dangerous.

it takes a few gigajoules to modulate whatever is being used as a signal carrier, usually it's a small bin of extra fine dust for optimal use, the matter will likely never need to be replaced.

modules require attached data drives of at least 3 terabytes of capacity.

the ray that the modules produce acts as a bore, ripping apart the energy carried by the matter, sub matter, Q matter, and anything that can be considered to be holding any sort of data, effectively erasing it.

Zara doesn't share or sell this and almost never puts it into a standard firearm shape, usually in a token or mounted in a drone
