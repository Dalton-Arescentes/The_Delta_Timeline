# The Manifest Cylinder
Originally named 
"Der Stab des Orbitalzerstörers" 
(The rod of the orbital destroyer)
Created by the leading royal scientist William D.G. & perfected by the 27th Veterus King the name has been lost or not taught, the technique can be picked up by listening to the prayer crystals of a Cleric of Mostus who have taken Adam Veterus or the Veterus Crown as their god or domain or learned from the teachings of the cleric.

The Cylinder is a Technique that scales with the strength of the Atiotermin (soul) that was used to make it, the cylinder can not be made permanent as it's internals must remain animated by the user.

Your soul must be at least class 2 (9-A+) in order to use it.

the length of the cylinder is six times the width, it's pattern can be repeated and grown in length as the parts for it are repeatable.

From the center of the rod a part is put into the cylinder and slammed into by the detonation of another part pulled in from the end, creating a primitive but extremely powerful canon powered & supplied by Determination
