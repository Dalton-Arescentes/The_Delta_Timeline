A young man who had contracted bit of wake energy from his father's hidden genocide of the frog folk, his genetics where mutated and significantly weakened without any benefits...

He grew up with the best Victorian era medicines thanks to the position of his father and survived into a semi stable adulthood.

After picking up a scroll full of schematics that a stranger had left in his house after meeting with his father he gained the idea of creating a mechanical servant and maybe a friend although he wouldn't realize the latter until after the plague came to the city and started killing his few actual friends.
