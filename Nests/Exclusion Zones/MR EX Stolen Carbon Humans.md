*the carbon humans find themselves waking from stasis pods dropping onto the floor with one directive on their new heads up display "Survive. Thrive. And Goodluck"*

*about half of them are pumped and the others are mind numbingly pissed off*

*immediately dismantling everything and building other more useful resources*

*they find themselves in a lab and from some of the barely working systems they can tell they are a few miles underground and the exit paths are windy and annoying*

*half of them are gonna get back home.

*[[Rotu]] a very young but extremely energetic carbon is having the time of their life just Fucken taking apart a entire computer system to make some armor and start putting together a plasma charge weapon*

*half of them are still having a absolute baby fit*

*they'll be pissy the entire Fucking time*

*Rotu proceeds to kill one of the carbons to take control over the group*

*they started in a lab so their scanning instead of leaving*

*unlike what the bounty hunter had they do not get a full detailed list of how to fight them but they do learn about the only variant this lab was able to discovered known as the "Armored Freaks" these ones skin has hardened into a protective exoskeleton that has become a dark grey with spike protrusions coming off their body requiring rifle calibers to pierce*

*id suggest a short barreled rifle with burst fire over full auto. They are from Adam so i assume they are smart enough to realize full auto is excessive and a way too waste ammo*

*yeah their definitely doing that, surprisingly 3 or 4 of them might be trained for this exact thing...*

> [!cite]  Carbon Human Query Language #Faction/Adam_Manufacturing/Lore CQL
> Carbon Humans have developed a language of their own with 3 or 4 variants of it for greater control over detail, context, & speed in as few words as possible.
> It is written like a query language like SQL & Spoken without most of the syntax as it's inferred with context & or intonation.
> It is spoken significantly faster then standard languages as well, up to the point of having 2,128 words per minute as it's current record.

when in small groups the hyper language of Adam Manufacturing's carbon humans starts to breakdown everyone's names into two syllable names for speed, names will change back to normal when the group is disbanded.

#Those-above-all/Alex has taken one of the carbons as a character, named [[Caleb]].

#Faction/Maelstorm/Umbrella_Corporation/Biological_Weapon_Attack_Squad
A Umbrealla unit called H.U.N.K. broke open the door and [[Rotu]] immediately shot him only to not have any effect and have his rifle bent, later after the Squad left Rotu attemped to fashion the rifle's battery into a bomb and attach it to a observer drone to send after them only to have the Vector unit uncloak and mag dumb into his head.

##### [[Rotu]] is now dead.
### 23 carbons remain 

The carbons will now make cloaking tech to use against everyone on their way out of the exclusion zone.

###### 2024-05-19

The carbons have started building X cars, Armor plated universal terrain cars with controllable wheel placement, making it so that the car can also climb bad terrain, float, or propel itself forward underwater or in space.

They've set their sights on a whole city to strip down for parts and to build a temporary base while they gather resources for the obelisk points to communicate with Adam Manufacturing.
