The Character sheet contains as many details of your character sheet.

There are two Character sheets you can use In depth and no depth, you are free to fill them out all at once or gradually, however you have to start with the following filled out.

Name, Health, Speeds, Footprint, Size, Level, Dice, Scale, Bonus, and Inventory 

Name
The name of your character, be it short or long, simple or impossible to pronounce, or simply the word of some object relevant to yourself, it is truly up to you.

Health
A number representing your condition relevant to combat, it may be related to how much luck you have remaining before you get a lethal injury, or how much endurance you have left before letting your injuries take you under.

Once you reach 0 Health your character is dead or damaged far beyond repair.

Speeds
How far your character can move in an actionable duration of time, you can have multiple speeds but all speeds have a combat version and a exploration version, the latter is 3x the former

Size
The amount of space a character takes up on the ground or a grid, 

Footprint
A value meant to help with grapples and similar interactions, it is normally listed after speeds, it is the number of points of your character that touch the ground, like feet, low tails and the such.

Note
Speed, Size, & Footprint are sometimes listed on one line in the following format
Speed & Footprint : 40ft/120ft, 2, 2ft 

40ft is the combat speed, 120ft is the exploration speed, 2 is the footprint & 2ft is the size
this is the stats of a average human

Level
A incremental set of two values to measure the progression through a campaign
