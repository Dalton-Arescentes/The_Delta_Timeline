*it's a metal bound book with pages of interwoven metal strand and characters acid burned and stained, in other words its a metal book

*it has no label but it's first page speaks of a mechanical hell baron made of red Ulfire, other world steel, and half royal imp blood

*They'd be able to find that it did have a title but it seems a few chapters have been mixed around, it's name is just "Dark's studies" there's a note on how the writer feels like his name was uncreative.

*he does actual call the creation a doom animatronic in a lot of instances, a quick skim through the book tells that he failed in the task of creating a artificial baron since they never acted the same as the other barons as well as the political structure getting in the way, oh as there were 17 different Baphomets at that time

*this book seems to have started out as a study report with dates on it, but it's clear it turned into a diary of sorts as the writer started to give the doom baron's a more humanoid form and started to teach them like people, but starting from the beginning.

*Dark was a android that had died and was forced to continue serving his original directive even in death, the nearest Baphomet notified this and started to feed him information and resources untill she trapped him in a cavern while in disrepair and gave him the mission of creating mechanical units for her army*
