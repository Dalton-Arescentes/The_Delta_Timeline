A offshoot of [[Knave]]

Player character's start at the 20th level of the dungeon and work their way up through layers of randomly generated appropriate levels to escape.

The levels are populated by semi non-lethal threats & environmental threats as well as various stores and rest points.

By default test points are anywhere you can draw a warm bath, you regain health & rest there.
In some game modes your harem might appear to help satisfy remaining tension, or just hang out and provide their skills and utilities.

Every 5 levels there is a store with the exception of level 20 & 19 where stores are introduced and gives the player character 1 item for free.
