[[Races]]



Fundamentally summarized as the mirror of chaos souls, with masculine features taking dominance, and the only difference between male and female is a size set, where males may be 4 to 7ft tall and females 11ft to 16ft tall.

there are 4 notable sub races with
Insectoid (including aquatic)
Reptilian (cause yuan ti go brr)
Capra (Goats)
Straight humanoid

the royal bloodlines are the only ones that have porcelain white skin however the smooth and shinny skin is a universal Noxi feature.

the lowest/most common form of Noxi energy is green although I haven't actually developed that much.

Sex organs, they have internal testicles adjacent to the womb as well as a slit or cuff allowing them to maintain a minimal silhouette, however they develop breasts when pregnant that don't naturally go away
