[[The Brotherhood of Gold]]
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_energy_projectile

The Brotherhood of Gold uses a set of templates and kits to enhance existing firearms to contain a pep Lazer assembly, allowing for their weapons to deal a range of damage & effectively have 10 to 30 times more capacity.

Bullets have been recessed to be power cells, the purpose of a weapon determines how much intensity it's set to, a pistol will likely be set to just above lethal while a heavy rifle would be set to spend the entire cell and eject it before the cell can fizzle into a pile of molten metal

They've created a special set of lense modules allowing for their weapons to remain effective at greater ranges, environments & keep the size of the plasma impact while using a dial or slide to adjust the intensity of the impacts ranging from non lethal use all the way to spending the entire cell 

non-lethal 9-C
able to knock people over from impact, start fires, & burn skin Instantly 

lethal 9-A
able to blow apart brick & bones alike, instantly turn plant matter to char, & "Sanitize" large zones

half power 8-B
capable of popping open heavily reinforced armor, blowing apart most natural materials, & damaging city level threats

full power 7-C+
Destroys heavy Armor, cause major instabilities in magic, Q-Effects, & Data streams for a few moments after discharge, plasma counts as blue Ulfire at this level

- Notable Weapon
# Set-Gun
Set in reference to the Egyptian god of them Creator, it was revealed when the Axis of supremacy managed to occupy one of their territories to cut them off from trade, now at least 3 of them must be kept on all bases at all times.

it shares the profile of a semi automatic Shotgun but with a heavy power cell & discharge point, one can choose to shoot a heavy hazardous dust into a 5ft to 10ft come in front of them and fire the electric discharge separately, giving the option to setup a trail for chain discharge.

the power cell is heavily armored and only accepts blue ulfire as charge, the ionizing dust is a 10 gauge shotgun shells filled with a chemical mixture that fires a non-flammable chemical & enough power to create a ionizing zone even in space.

Older Versions are known for being extremely durable, but the newest versions can passively generate a shot of ionizing gas to use when out of shells

Damage 5-B
Known for Completely reducing anything below 6-C to atoms
Creates a cone of lightning mixed with blue ulfire
Damage is not adjustable

- Notable Weapon
Bog1911

Using existing m1911 pistols & a lens assembly to recreate the same range & use their enhanced pip technology, this pistol is standard issue to soldiers, guards & police (with appropriate changes).

This pistol is used in the weapon labs as an example for how to implement their technology.

in most cases the pistol cannot use full or even half power,  cells are not ejected & spent magazines are expected to be returned to a deposit.

the common indicator of this modification or use of the technology is a transparent trigger, bright yellow trigger,  cells in place of bullets with the mag  & bog standard notion engraving inside the slide mechanism.

Nagant_BOG4667

one of the few civilian/police pepguns that allows for full power, having a special alloy to prevent the cells from sticking or fizzling

- Notable Weapon

GTm0061C

full name
Grand Tech Model 0061 Combiner
Made by yūgō (Blind Parabloid of bog)

Available for androids and cyborgs

Due to the custom machining and the resources needed the brotherhood has accepted the help for the Kappa Corporation to produce this.

Auto cannon with the ammunition stored in a shoulder with the mechanics & the barrels taking up the rest of the arm.

It's Compatible with 20mm Adam Manufacturing Ammunition packs with the exception that the ammunition packaging needs to be manually removed & the propriety battery is unused.

the damage is equal to a 20 caliber bullet using it's own ammunition or Ammo packs™, the damage significantly increases when the barrels are powered with bog mag rail technology
