$$Major Traits$$

- Hell bound respawn
After every death ask the [[The Oracle]] if you respawn somewhere safe.
Roll Strength every time to break the skin layer over the hoodlum's face, 10 and under is a fail meaning it will need to be ripped or torn later.
While the skin is unbroken you are semi blind, mute, and unable to consume most things.
16 and over your face will be similar to the one you had in life.
20 and over will have the same face as the one you had in life.
