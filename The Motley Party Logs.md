[[Raine (MP)]], [[Undies (MP)]], [[Pirate Captain Bob Barker (MP)]], 

Pets : Scaly (a 7ft tall humanoid lizard), Janet (a friendly ooze pet)
Work force : [[The Ashen Flames (MP)]]

The party is on the ship of the ashen flames in the [[Trade nation of Eutrez MP (7-1(3-8))]]

Raine recounted what she knows of the monoliths threatening to destroy the world 
![[Raine (MP)#Lore 1]] 

Mr. Tema (Systema Himself) popped in for a moment to add that the monoliths could also detonate and erase everyone from existence and left

The party has returned back to the mines where the monolith is.

*you three have entered into the deep mines, a ominous cyan light illuminates the cavern as they see the monolith a few miles away, the entire cavern seems to stretch and twist around it leading downward...
Raine smells something normal?...
Bravo can sense there used to be great magic here...
Bob....
Bob sees all of the corpses and the piles of gold & silver at the bottom near the monolith*
,*It looks like the caverns has about 5 layers, but the combination of landscape and mining equopment *

this is the IRL hosting version of where Square was born, a eldritch god of normalcy
