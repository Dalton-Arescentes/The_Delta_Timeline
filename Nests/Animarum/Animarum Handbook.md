# [-](Animarum) Preface
 Hello and welcome reader to the Animarum Handbook, within are details on how to play, host or make Animarum, and hopefully a fun time.

Animarum was inspired by the games held in & stories from various communities such as `ultramonke`'s zero server, `adrenaline_junkie_`’s server and the events of the souls story line in The Dwarfs Inn server, Without them and `bluematt` and his lovely scaling system, this collision of inspirations wouldn’t have been possible, other credits will be added with permission or request.

Using Ben Milton’s [Knave](Knave.md) as a base with inspiration from [Open Legend](https://openlegendrpg.com/)'s variety of stats to create a system that can be used for any setting and any game with the bonus of scaling, war gaming, investigation, reality breaking or just good old dungeon delving.

We use discord come check us out Here, at [The Coffee Stains Center](https://discord.com/invite/hABtyvqYcb).
You can browse more resources at [The Git Repository](https://github.com/Dalton-Arescentes/Animarum)

# Features

## No Classes
Every Character is made of Major and minor traits with appropriate restrictions & the correct tools and training. 

## Optional Player Facing rolls
Anyone can roll for anyone, there is no valid arrangement, Host rolls all dice, players roll all dice doesn't matter so long as it's fun, group willing they could even eliminate the host position so long as hidden actions are shared with at least two trusted players.

## Copper Standard
Much like knave, Animarum will also list out it's currency in copper pennies or common pieces, expansions should contain an exchange rate. 

##  Scaling
All rolls use the scale dice and one of the 18 abilities, 10 if you don't count extraordinary abilities, this allows for games to be hosted from the mundane everyday person surviving each and every grueling encounter with a demon, or a adventurer diving into a dungeon all the way up into the affairs of factions, gods and what may stand above. 

> [!example] 10-C Hound Dogs 
> They scale at 10-C, so they roll a d6 and have a Bonus/Defense of 3.

> [!example] 10-A A well trained Guard
> That unit would roll a d12, because they scale at 10-A and therefore have a Bonus/Defense of 6.

> [!example] 9-C The Adventurer (D&D, Pathfinder, Knave Default)
> These roll a d20 in other games and therefor scale at 9-C, which lines up relatively well.

> [!example] Continental God
> Generally gods pose more of a threat to the destruction of their homeland, so Scaling at 7-A and rolling a d30.

Actions that are described in greater detail are considered more powerful then those that are not.

## `[Traits]`
There are two types of traits, `[Major]` and  `[Minor]`, they follow the same syntax as the inventory, including starting with a hyphen for the sake of separation.

Charge is assumed to refill at sanctuaries visits, unless otherwise stated.
Quality is usually linked to something physical like a spell focus, or a piece of tech with the exceptions of not taking slots in the inventory, not recording the hands needed.
Uppercase C meaning cost, and lowercase meaning charges.

Extremely important things like things that have the potential to mechanically interact with the game or plot relevant should be added in the form of traits, as usual speak with your host about adding them.
When writing down a trait make sure to add a hyphen, minus, plus or a asterisk before the name, this helps separate and declare a trait.


> [!example]
> ```
> - Enduring (1/1c)
> 	Once a sanctuary visit you may give yourself 
> 	advantage on a fortitude check or a plus 5 to your 
> 	fortitude defense.
> - Fidgeting
>	Needs a play item or will figet
> + Very slight kleptomania 
>     It's my inventory space, gotta use it
> * Watched Watch
>     Never miss a second
> ```
> - Enduring (1/1c)
> 	Once a sanctuary visit you may give yourself 
> 	advantage on a fortitude check or a plus 5 to your 
> 	fortitude defense.
> - Fidgeting
>	Needs a play item or will figet
> + Very slight kleptomania 
>     It's my inventory space, gotta use it
> * Watched Watch
>     Never miss a second


### `[Major]`
Grants or declares a new type of action, stunt, or bonus or a large interaction with the system like Spell Casting, Martial Techniques, or anything that can make a significant difference in a actionable time.

> [!example] 
> - Shortcut (10/10c)
>When you move through a doorway with no one who can see you on the other side, you may choose to teleport to another doorway you know of within Movement Miles.
>c = Knowing Defense. 
### `[Minor]`
Doesn't directly grant any sort of bonus but usually adds a role play element that may be useful like Obsessive Timekeeping, Natural Climber, Heavy Sleeping.

> [!example] 
> - Sheltered
Often you are completely clueless & Innocent about things outside of your small world.

---


## `[Inventory]`
Character's have a number of slots equal to their fortitude defense, most items will take up 1 slot like a cup, small bottle, or a book, larger items will take more slots like armor, larger weapons.

Groups of similar items can be stacked like coins or paper, however it is up to the group or host.

It is strongly recommended for you to use the key in order to keep your inventory readable.
### Inventory Syntax 
- x# Example item `(#d#, #A, #h, #/#c, #s, #/#Q)`

|    Symbol    |     |    Expanded     |
| :----------: | :-: | :-------------: |
|      #       |  =  | Number of items |
| Example Item |     |    Item name    |
|      (       |     | Start of Stats  |
|      d       |  =  |      dice       |
|      A       |  =  |      Armor      |
|      h       |  =  |      hands      |
|      s       |  =  |      slots      |
|      c       |  =  |    capacity     |
|      Q       |  =  |     Quality     |
|      )       |     |  End of Stats   |
Always start a item with a dot, minus, dash or hyphen to separate it from other items much like you would for traits, otherwise use them in the order they are in on the table, if there is a 1 in x, d, h, c or Q don't write it down, it'l be assumed to be 1. 

On the lines after you can add mechanics & descriptions, here is a example item.

> [!example]
> - Sharp Poisonous stick (1d4, 1s, 2/2q)
> fortitude goal 10 on fail the target becomes uncomfortably hot and nauseous for 4d10 minutes.
> a large brown stick with a blob of black poison on the end causing a sickening effect.

## Dice Rolls 
If a character attempts a action or stunt where their failure has consequences they would roll their scale dice plus a relevant ability to meet or beat a goal number.

If the roll is opposed by another character the goal number will be their appropriate defense score, if the roll is under or meets the goal number or defense it fails as the defender always wins.

There are some things that will make rolls easier or harder, the group or host will grant disadvantage or advantage appropriately.

## Combat Framing
Before the start of each round flip a coin to determine if player characters or non player characters go first, on heads player characters first.

Characters all act at the same time, players can coordinate their actions or choose not to and the same goes for the enemies, for the sake of simulation you can also order them with agility scores.

### Action Points - AP
At the start of each round all characters gain one free movement action and one action point to spend on one the following selection.

Characters have a limit of 4 & -4 action points that they can have. 

If you have no ap you can't take any actions aside from your free movement. 

> [!hint] 
> You could use a d4, d8, or paper to keep track of your action points.

### Movement Action
- Cost: 1ap after 1 use.
- Limit: you can not move more then twice a round.

You move some or all of your speed's distance, you may interrupt your movement action with other actions such as stunts and attacks.
### Stunt 
- Cost: 1ap
- Limit: can not be a direct attack

Interact with objects and characters, things like trying to stun, shove, disarm, trip & break things will require a roll or a verses save, but grappling is handled by a separate action.

May indirectly damage, like shoving off a cliff.

The host & group decides the appropriate limits to a stunt, as they are meant to allow for generic actions during combat.

Speaking in general can't be done while focusing, but can still be done.

### Grapple
- Cost: 1ap
attempt to grapple a target & roll might versus their agility, fortitude, or might defense, if you win, you prevent the target from taking the movement action & remove 1 footprint, if you lose you miss.

As a stunt action they can struggle and roll might against your grapple roll, if they pass they break the grapple and escape, if they lose they lose another footprint.

you roll grapple every round until you let go, they break free or the target's footprint hits 0, at which point they can only use stunts to escape the grapple at disadvantage or zero down.

The Target does not recover footprint until the break the grapple.

### Zero 
- Cost: 0ap
- Gain: 1ap & take half damage for the round.
- Limit: Can't be taken after other actions, can't take actions after, can't be taken if Ap is negative.

You spend the round avoiding damage, using your shield, dodging incoming attacks, analyzing the combat, or similar.

### Dropping Advantage
- Gain: 1ap
- Limit: Can only be used once a round, can't gain more then 1ap

You drop your advantage in exchange for a additional action point, you only gain one no matter how much you drop.

### Dropping Disadvantage
- Cost: 1ap
- Limit: Can only be used once a round, can't gain more then 1ap


You drop your disadvantage at the cost of an action point, you only gain one no matter how much you drop.

### Pass at a cost
- Cost: Point of quality from a piece of equipment or a additional injury or something determined by group/host & context

you can choose to force a failed roll to succeed at a cost.

### Melee Attack
- Cost: 1ap
Attempt to strike adjacent targets with a scale roll + Might, if the result is higher then the armor of the attack hits & deals weapon effect, if not it misses.
%% that's right defender wins! %%

### Ranged Attack
- Cost: 1ap
Fire at targets within your weapon's range with a scale roll + Perception, if the result is higher then the armor of the attack hits & deals weapon effect, if not it misses.


## Defenses

When rolling against something you'll need to beat it's defense, for example their armor or appropriate stat, the same goes for attacks against you.

The defense of a stat is itself plus your scaling bonus.
Armor is included in this as well, making the armor bonus plus your scaling bonus, if you don't have any armor you could add your Dexterity or Fortitude stats, although keep in mind armor may provide additional boons or banes

## Dis/Advantage 

Characters can gain advantage in combat by attacking a target that is unaware, on lower ground, off balance, disarmed, distracted, or tactically disadvantaged in any significant way.
The referee, as usual, has the final say.

Advantage is in terms of dice rolling a scale roll twice and taking the higher result.
in dice notion advantage is marked by kh1 for keep highest one.
kl1 for keep lowest one for example.

| Scale  |  Dis/advantage   | Example   |
| ------ |:----------------:| --------- |
| `9-C`  |    advantage     | `2d20kh1` |
| `10-B` |   disadvantage   | `2d8kl1`  |
| `7-C`  | triple advantage | `3d24kh1` |


## Exploding Dice!

Exploding dice for when damage could be extremely unpredictable or unstable. 

An '`!`' marks the value a dice explodes on, taking the current value and rolling it again to add it, when this effect is used it is up to the group to limit how recursive this gets.

for example `4d6!6` rolls 4d6, and if any landed on 6 another d6 gets rolled and added.

| dice          | example                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `4d6!6`       | roll another d6 when a 6 is rolled                                  |
| `20d20!18~20` | roll another d20 when a 18, 19 or 20 is rolled                      |
| `3d8!6kh2`    | roll another d8 when a 6 is rolled and keep the highest two results | 

## Critical Rolls & Quality

A Critical Roll is a roll where the scale dice landed on it's maximum value or minimum value.

If a roll is made with a max crit they can chose to deal a point of damage to the quality of a piece of their target's equipment in addition to their damage or they can roll their attack's effect or damage again.

If a roll is made with a min crit their attack land's on themselves or damages their own equipment as decided by the host.

At 0 quality, the item is destroyed or rendered unusable. 
Each point of quality costs 10% of the item’s cost to repair.

Outside of combat a max roll can still cause incredible success & a min roll can still invoke horrid failure both are up to the Host or group. 

## Downtime
### Sanctuary & Healing
After a meal and rest characters roll a d8 + Fortitude to regain health.

Resting at a Sanctuary, a safe place where you have access to materials to help yourself recover and treat your injuries, typically also regain uses of abilities & traits unless otherwise stated.

## Advancement

Whenever a Character accumulates 1,000 XP, they gain a level. 
As a guideline, 50 XP for low-risk accomplishments, 100 XP for moderate-risk accomplishments, 200 XP for high-risk accomplishments. 
The Host should freely notify the Characters of how much XP different objectives are worth when asked. 
When a Character gains a level, they roll a number of d8s equal to their new level to find their new HP maximum. 
If the result is less than their previous maximum, their maximum HP increases by 1. 
They also raise the scores of 3 different abilities of their choice by 1 point.

## Scaling

> [!warning] 
> ```
> Do not focus on scaling, not all campaigns are meant for god like levels of power.
> ```

\Whenever a character hits level 20 they lose all their levels & go up one step in their scaling, which only increases your dice & defense stat-wise.

The default scaling is 9-C, granting you a d20 dice & a bonus of 10.




![[Scaling Sheet]]

---

# A walk though the character sheet
%% Rework, more effort lol %%
The Character sheet contains as many details of your character, lets walk through them, there are two Character sheets you can use In depth and no depth, you are free to fill them out all at once or gradually.

## Health 
A number representing your condition relevant to combat, it may be related to how much luck you have remaining before you get a lethal injury, or how much endurance you have left before letting your injuries take you under.

Once you reach 0 health you enter a critical state and will die by the end of the combat or event without significant help to stabilize you or regain hp.

### Healing Rate
How much health you regain at a rest or the initial part of sanctuary visit.
It is (Half your levels)d8 + fortitude.

## Movement stats
### Speeds  
How far your character can move in a round.
You have a two speeds, a exploration speed which is three times longer then your combat speed.
You may have several set of speeds like for swimming or climbing. 

The default speed is 40ft/120ft

### Size  

The amount of space a character takes up on the ground or a grid.
the default size is 4ft.

### Footprint  

A value meant to help with grapples and similar interactions, it is normally listed after speeds, it is the number of points of your character that touch the ground, like feet, low tails and the such.

The Default is 2.

## Level  
A incremental set of two values to measure the progression through a campaign.

The Default is 1

### Experince Points 
The Default is 0000/1000xp

## Scaling
Where you scale in the world or out of it, it can determine a lot of how you interact with the game...

### Dice 
The dice you roll for your checks

### Bonus/Defense
Half of the max value of your dice, used for the defenses of your stats, armor and abilities.

# Creation
Start by copying the sheet you want to use from Character Sheets to your paper or document

Health is rolled with a d8.
All of your stats & genmod if you are using one  are rolled with `2d4kh1`.

For now we'll be using the details & store from Knave, hopefully soon we'll have our own store.

If you have access to the Avrae discord bot & have inline rolling enabled use this to generate them all at once.
