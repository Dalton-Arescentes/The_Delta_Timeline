        Preface


This system is made with the intention of adding some mechanics to role playing not to role play within mechanics, to have as few hard limits as possible.

I (@dalton_arescentes) had gotten tired of D&D 3.5 & D&D 5e and didn't much care for pathfinder, gurps, or Open Legend as I found learning and committing to a new system to be too time consuming as I lost free time to other things, so I tried 
[Knave (link to knave)]
 and loved it, and so i built off it from there even using the stats from 
[Open Legends (link to open legends)] 
for a full stat block.

I retain strict control over the core, community suggestions are welcome but look into HEX before making any


        Introduction


Animarum is a System for lightweight Roleplaying games, with a focus of being easy to pick up and run.

This book will go though and show you how to play, it is worth noting that the items are left as generic so you can change them to whatever fits.


        How to play


You will need at least a dice, pen and paper, but the current medium is google documents or messages and digital dice.


        Character Creation


1. Minimal or Full
Pick between Minimal or Full
minimal character sheet only uses a Gen mod of 1 (^generic modifier) and allows you to finish the character much faster, but a full character sheet will come with a full 18 stats.

2. Stats 
While a gen mod may cover everything stats for more finite play can be used.

there are three categories 
    Physical
Might
Agility
Fortitude

    Mental
Learning
Logic
Perception
Willpower

    Exceptional
Alteration
Changing one thing to another though some uncommon method, like magic or ray-gun

Creation
Use a Higher powers, manifest something from nothing, regenerate, empower

Energy
Create and control elements

Entropy
Disintegrate matter, create sickness, kill with a word

Influence
Control the minds of others, speak telepathically, manipulate emotions, and use illusions

Movement
Teleport, fly, hasten, use telekinesis

Prescience
See the future, read motives, perceive far locations, sense magic or evil, contact other realms

Protection
save from harm, break influences, magics


You roll these stats in order of listing with 2d4 and keep the highest, once you have done that you can chose 4 stats and swap their values as you please.

each of these stats have a defense score of itself plus ten, for example if your fortitude was 3 you'd add 10 to get a defense of 13.

The following text can be copy and pasted into a discord with inline rolling enabled on the Avrae bot, Due to how time consuming it is to roll 18 sets of 2d4 is, I’d suggest using digital dice.

3. Details and all the fun
You should understand what a name is, if not, hello and welcome to earth.
roll a d8 for your health and add your fortitude stat to it, your armor is 10 + your fortitude, agility or what your armor provides.
(some worlds use 100HP for everyone to encourage strategy)

your speeds will usually be 120ft exploring, 40ft in combat, with 2 footprints with a 5ft zone written as

Speeds & Footprint : 120ft & 40ft, 2, 5ft

but can be altered when appropriate, like a additional footprint when a character has a tail they can stand on, or a smaller zone if their small.

Your Level usually starts at 1 or even 0 for the daring
Your Scale is 9-C (d20) unless you and your host can understand the scaling system put into the end of this document, your scale dice is a d20

Now you can fill out the details section, your gender, race and such, however your Background is the most important one and often is one or two words of well understood context like "City police" or "Church Scribe", if you need more context feel free to link to a resource that has it or attach another paper containing it.

4. Inventory, grants & the generic store

Characters have a number of item slots equal to their Fortitude defense, something that will be explained later.

Most items, including spell books, potions, a day’s rations, light weapons,
tools and so on take up 1 slot, but particularly heavy or bulky items like
armor or medium to heavy weapons may take up more slots.

Groups of small, identical items may be bundled into the same slot, at the
GM’s discretion. 100 coins can fit in a slot.

As a general guideline, a slot holds around 5 pounds of weight.
Here is a key to keep your inventory smaller on paper.

Inventory [_/_ Slots Used]

#a  = Armor
#s  = Slots
#d# = Damage
#h  = Hands
#c/#c = Capacity
#Q/#Q = Quality

Characters can start with 2 days of rations and one weapon of their player’s
choice.

Ask your game master for how much money you start with and what it
will be called.

you may grant yourself items appropriate to your background and position within the Host's approval.

4. how to play, host and existing

If you attempt to do something where you may not succeed you make a roll with your scale dice, again typically being a d20 and the most appropriate stat or stats added to it.

to shove heavy box would be a might roll
to snatch a fish from a pond would be a agility roll

sometimes you'll have a significant advantage or disadvantage on some rolls.
with advantage roll your scale dice twice and pick the highest.
with disadvantage roll your scale dice twice and pick the lowest.

During an attack roll, if the attacker rolls max (^nat 20 for 9-C) or the defender rolls a natural 1, the defender’s armor loses 1 point of quality and they take an additional die of damage.
If the attacker rolls a natural 1 or the defender rolls max (^nat 20 for 9-C), the attacker’s weapon loses 1 point of quality.
At 0 quality, the item is destroyed.
(^Each point of quality costs 10% of the item’s cost to repair)

At the start of each combat round, determine initiative by flipping a coin. 
On tails, all of the enemies will act first, On heads all of the Player's Characters will act first (^in agility order if they can't agree), initiative is redone each round

Characters get 1 action & 1 move, they can discard their actions to move twice.

Armor is half the number of sides of thier scale dice 10 if scale is 9-C + their fortitude or agility stats, armor like chainmail may provide additional benefits but overrides the fortitude and agility.

When a character reaches 0 HP they are unconscious or unable to move & act, any more damage kills the character, you can recoever HP d8+ Fortitude stat  after a meal and a night's rest, resting at a sanctuary may recover all lost HP but not lost limbs unless appropriate equipment is there.

    Meta Actions
Loan Action (^Double up)
loan actions from your next turns to gain actions to a limit of 4 actions, actions are payed back on following turns

Guard (^Zero Down)
Give up your action this turn to reduce incoming damage by ½ and gain a action the turn after you stop, you can't gain more then 4 actions from this.

    Action list
Attack (Melee)
a roll with the might stat added to it vs the armor of the target, on a result higher then the armor damage is delt.
alternatively
the target may make roll and add thier armor to it vs the might defence of the target

Attack (Ranged)
same as Melee but with the perception used instead of might

Grapple
prevent a target from moving, roll might vs thier might defence or agility defence on a pass you remove 1 of their contact points from the ground and prevent them from moving that turn, when you reduce their contact points to 0 you are now holding them, they may make attempts to escape your gapple at disadvantage

Stunt
everything else, slamming a door, drinking from a flask quickly, stunning, shoving, disarming, tripping, add the most appropriate stat
