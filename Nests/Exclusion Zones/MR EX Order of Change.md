8 Skinskins from RLD's Order of Change stolen and thown into a exclusion zone

###### 2024-04-27
*the skin skins appear in a small shelter with a few unarmed survivors only enough for half of them to have food*

Este nevoie de sacrificiul tău 
*skinskin do da skinskin thing*

uhm- ² where did they come from

*there are 8 black variant skinskins, their hair, eyes, and internal color are black, they don't attack immediately as they just look around, all of them speak Romanian so they'll have to wait to get more words from them*

³ they are just- sitting there

I guess we should start talking, does anyone here know this language?
*in Romanian cause g translate isn't working rn*
*2 of them split off to look around, please tell me that they are not shirtless*

*no they arent all of them have survivor esk clothes*

*still in Romanian*
where are we?...

*there is one that's already fixated on the one that's backing away*

⁴ An apocalyptic wasteland *is watching that one closely being the onlt one on guard*

*nudges the one that's fixated and tells him to go check further out*
sorry, [[Acno]] has a habit of staring

⁴ uh huh. *its clear he can smell that they are very different*

*ohh yeah they absolutely smell like parasites if they have that Sense of smell, also is there like a corner where the ones that were sent off can get out of sight?*

⁴ *most definitely*

*then two of them have already disappeared*

⁴ *has booked it out the bunkers later hatch and onto the surface holding his breath as he runs into a nearby building to escape the toxic gas*

skinskin*also the moment he turned they all Fucken lept forward and inverted to forcefully take them*

*this flusters them quite a lot as they quickly reduce their number to the 3, the 5 of them inverting again and entering dormancy, a very rare skill for skinskins to instinctivelt know*

*essentially 5 of the  are now 4 inch in diameter dark grey balls*

*after the elicit content to be displayed in a thread at request, they'd Fucking immediately move onto a new location as they know that one knows*

*they step out into the decrepit city a dull green fog in the air like dust that hasnt settled. The stars above that rotate around above Exclusion Zone-00107007002 shine through the fog. Giving everything a green hue*

*the bunker doesnt have much except some of course gas masks food water supplies and ammo. Tho no firearms*

*they'd swe the forth guy dart acrpssthe buildings above them at 80mph seeming to either be ignoring them or havent noticed em*

*nope, they're just gonna Fucken avoid him and keep a lookout, they don't want to be here, depending on scale these people will last them 6 months or longer and they'd prefer to find a group before then*

*their skins would ripple as they pull materials, drastically changing their appearances and intentionally damaging the clothing while putting a bit of paste and matching color silova onto anything small that can be used to identify them*

*their goal is to Fucken leave*

*they are almost smack dab in the middle of the city as a distorted inhuman scream is heard from above before a body is flung just below brealing the sound barrier into the ground the guy from before standing up on a roof as he'd toss down a bag clearly for the skin skins. As he gives them a middle finger before vanishing away i to the city*

*they're gonna look into the body & the back, maybe make the body into another bag*

*the bag has a couple of knives a few flash lights a map with raider camps inside the city with one marked as "wont attack on sight" and a notebook with hand drawn combat illustrations of how to take on different amounts of freakers at once and their currently very slight variations as well as a sticky note that says "fuck you. You killed my friends. But i cannot let you suffer the same fate my camp has. Do not try to eat the freakers. And thats what they are called. So you dont stick out too much. Ps. Stay the fuck away from me. Next time i wont show mercy*

*they haven't pierced the ones they're using as hosts get soooo guess what?~*
*they're still alive just horribly violated & drugged, and now they're discussing if it's possible to give these people up once they get to one of the camps, as they're already thinking about the long term effect of taking these units off the board.*

*if the hosts act up too much  between now and then they will be pieced which is a combination of lobotomization and ?chemical possession?*

*they arent actually strong enough to fight back too hard and do to being drugged they tend to just exists not having a great tolerancej

*their primary mission is to get near one do the population centers and skim information*

they approach the friendly settlement as a group of woman to reduce suspicion, which somehow worked.

*a group of survivors infront of a large moving truck that is inbetween two sheet metal boxes a clear gate* How the fuck have you survived??

It's been hard...
*because exploitive nature go brr the 3 of them have used the trued and true female sex appeal to try avoiding questions*
we've been surviving in a small base not far from here

*>-> this works surprisingly or not surprisingly*

*they ask what they can do to get food and drink*

*simple work around the camp sense they are women they are given the option for mainly cooking water cleaning welding the base defenses. And scouting*

*more then happy to do so as again fooooood... actually more importantly water but isn't showing it*

*do to their i assume increased perception theyd notice some flaws in the gate making it so the truck cant be backed into one of the cubes do to a piece rebar sticking out from one of the cubes*

*they don't have a heightened perception at least not for their environment, but they are trained so they'll notice it after a little while and just fix it the next time they're on that job without saying anything*

*they'll also occasionally back to "that base nearby" up to 5 times*

*they're also going to cut the Tongues out of the ones they were originally using, dose them into a small coma and come back claiming to have found them*

*but what about the community?
wouldn't the community try to keep them?~*

*the community would yes but the bounty hunter was following them to try to atleast get his buddies dog tags but he couldnt miss this opportunity*

*fair enough, they just tried to minimize the bad blood*

*the tounge removing was primary for their safety >_>*

*the note says "hello. Again. I've left "bodies" of those traveling with you to be found by scouting parties from their camp so your in the clear"*

*They're actually gonna carefully use this, appreciating it, now for their overarching thing*

*One of them starts to show interest in any legends they have and if anyone has heard of [[The Grail of Freeform]]*

*funnily enough they have many legends formed over the 4 years since the outbreak*
*it's kinda important. just a little bit y'know?
if there're any telepaths it's literally the only thing they think about continuously

that one will do their best to listen to their legends and even write them down if paper is ready*






###### 2024-05-02

they are summoned via note attached to arrow to come to [[The Radio Tower]].

It is the [[Bounty Hunter]] from their initial encounter asking them to infiltrate a camp under suspicion of them feeding the freakers.

the *Seemingly* two from the order of change accept the task.
they accepted the job to infiltrate a faction that is feeding their own people to the Freakers on the principle of their own order.
