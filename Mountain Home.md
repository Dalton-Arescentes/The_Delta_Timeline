#Location/Reality/Animarum/Mountain_Home 

*There used to be a city here in this mountain carved out by the races of a country together as a celebration of the end of war, it would have been the biggest city in systema and the pride and joy of meny gods, architected by kindness of a mother and built by the back of a father to protect the hope of his daughter....

*the father now walks the valleys of the city hunting the cars and Rott...

*the streamers and decorations at the city halls and celebration centers are still up, "Hurrah for progress!" in dozens of languages...

*he lives in a Mobile home at the center of the city not leaving what was his daughter's hope...

*Mountain Home, people throughout the entire country had been excited to see it, the opening and the celebration was to be live televised on the 3rd channel of the TV network...

*the TV's now show a live view rotated 90Â° showing the corner of a recliner chair and the and of a child limp, with a insect from the Rott hitting the camera every now and then...

*This man should be dead, he Is dead he just doesn't know It yet...
