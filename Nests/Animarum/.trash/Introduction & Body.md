## No Classes
Every Character is made of Major and minor traits with appropriate restrictions & the correct tools and training. 
## Optional Player Facing rolls
Anyone can roll for anyone, there is no valid arrangement, Host rolls all dice, players roll all dice doesn't matter so long as it's fun, group willing they could even nearly eliminate the host position so long as hidden actions are shared with at least two trusted players.
## Copper Standard
much like knave & Other, Animarum will also list out it's currency in copper pennies or common pieces, expansions should contain an exchange rate. 
##  Dice Scales
All rolls use the scale dice and one of the 18 abilities, 10 if you don't count extraordinary abilities.

The dice you roll changes with your scale, a hound would roll a d6, a well trained guard a d12, a extremely well trained adventurer would roll a d20, the god of a continent a d30 and so on, however actions that are described in greater detail are considered more powerful then those that are not.

damage scales as well, for example a tier 7 character deals ten times more amage to a tier 8, and twenty times as much to a tier 9 and so on, likewise you would receive a 10th of the damage from a tier 8, and a 20th of the damage from a tier 9 and so on.

## `[Traits]`
there are two types of traits, `[Major]` and  `[Minor]`, they follow the same syntax as the inventory, charges is assumed to refill at sanctuaries & quality is usually linked to something physical like a spell focus, or a piece of tech with the exceptions of not taking slots in the inventory, not recording the hands needed, & uppercase C meaning cost, and lowercase meaning charges.
### `[Major]`

Grants a new type of action, stunt, or bonus or a large interaction with the system like Spell Casting, Martial Techniques, or anything that can make a significant difference in a actionable time.

here is a example.

- Shortcut (10/10c)
When you move through a doorway with no one who can see you on the other side, you may choose to teleport to another doorway you know of within Movement Miles. c = Knowing Defense.
### `[Minor]`

Doesn't directly grant any sort of bonus but usually adds a role play element that may be useful like Obsessive Timekeeping, Natural Climber, Heavy Sleeping.

here is a example

- Sheltered
Often you are completely clueless & Innocent about things outside of your small world.

---
## `[Inventory]`

Character's have a number of slots equal to their fortitude defense, most items will take up 1 slot like a cup, small bottle, or a book, larger items will take more slots like armor, larger weapons.

Groups of similar items can be stacked like coins or paper, however it is up to the group or host.

It is strongly recommended for you to use the key in order to keep your inventory readable.
### Inventory Syntax 
- x# Example item `(#d#, #h, #/#c, #s, #/#Q)`

| Symbol |     |    Expanded     |
| :----: | :-: | :-------------: |
|   x    |  =  | Number of items |
|        |     |    Item name    |
|   (    |     | Start of Stats  |
|   d    |  =  |      dice       |
|   h    |  =  |      hands      |
|   s    |  =  |      slots      |
|   c    |  =  |    capacity     |
|   Q    |  =  |     Quality     |
|   )    |     |  End of Stats   |
Always start a item with a dot, minus or dash to separate it from other items, otherwise use them in the order they are in on the table, if there is a 1 in x, d, h, c or Q don't write it down, it'l be assumed to be 1. 

on the lines after you can add a description, here is a example item.

- Sharp Poisonous stick (1d4, 1s, 2/2q)
a large brown stick with black poison on the end.
sickening effect fortitude goal 10 on fail the target becomes uncomfortably hot and nauseous for 4d10 minutes.

## Dice Rolls 
If a character attempts a action or stunt where their failure has consequences they would roll their scale dice plus a relevant ability to meet or beat a goal number.

If the roll is opposed by another character the goal number will be their appropriate defense score, if the roll is under or meets the goal number or defense it fails as the defender always wins.

There are some things that will make rolls easier or harder, the group or host will grant disadvantage or advantage appropriately.

## Combat
At the start of combat flip a coin, on heads the Characters go first and on tails the enemies go first, flip the coin again every round to determine who goes first.

Characters all act at the same time, players can coordinate their actions or choose not to and the same goes for the enemies, for the sake of simulation you can also order them with agility scores.

At the start of the round all characters gain one movement action and 1 pending action to spend on their choice from the following selection.

#### Pending actions
The number of pending actions a character has is limited to between -4 & 4 not counting 0.

At the start of a round you gain one pending action & may not double up until the number is positive.

Pending actions carry over though rounds allowing you to build up or recover them

##### Double up
As a free action you grant yourself 1 to 3 more pending actions at the cost of losing the same number of pending actions next round.

##### Zero
As a full round action you take Â½ incoming damage & gain a pending action next round.

You can not spend pending actions during a round where you have used a zero action.
You can no zero after using a pending action.

### Movement 
As a movement action you move some or all of your speed, you may interrupt your movement action with most other actions such as stunts and attacks.

Once per round you may use a pending action to use your movement action again.

### Stunt 
As a pending action you can interact with objects and characters, things like trying to stun, shove, disarm, trip & break things will require a roll or a verses save, but grappling is handled by a separate action.

They may not cause damage directly, but may indirectly damage, like shoving off a cliff.

The host & group decides the appropriate limits to a stunt, as they are meant to allow for generic actions during combat.

### Attack  
#### Melee
As a pending action you may strike adjacent targets with a scale roll + Might, if the result is higher then the armor of the attack hits & deals weapon effect, if not it misses.
#### Ranged 
As a pending action you may fire at targets within range with a scale roll + Perception, if the result is higher then the armor of the attack hits & deals weapon effect, if not it misses.

### Grapple
as a pending action you grapple a target & roll might versus their agility, fortitude, or might defense, if you win, you prevent the target from taking the movement action & remove 1 footprint, if you lose you miss.

as a stunt action they can struggle and roll might against your grapple roll on their turn, if they pass they break the grapple and escape, if they lose they lose another footprint.

you roll grapple every round until you let go, they break free or the target's footprint hits 0, at which point they can only use stunts to escape the grapple at disadvantage or zero down.

The Target does not recover footprint until the break the grapple.

## Dis/Advantage 
Characters can gain advantage in combat by attacking a target that is unaware, on lower ground, off balance, disarmed, distracted, or tactically disadvantaged in any significant way.
The referee, as usual, has the final say. 
When a character has advantage against an opponent on their combat turn, they may either;
Apply advantage to their attack roll or stunt against that opponent.
or 
Make an attack and a stunt attempt in the same round against that opponent, without advantage.

in dice notion advantage is marked by kh1 for keep highest one, kl1 for keep lowest one, for example `2d20kh1 +3` is valid

## Exploding Dice!
Characters can have dice explode when a effect includes it! kl kl
a exclamation mark marks the value a dice explodes on, taking the current value and rolling it again to add it, when this effect is used it is up to the group to limit how recursive this gets.

for example `4d6!6` rolls 4d6, and if any landed on 6 another d6 gets rolled and added.

## Critical Rolls & Quality
In combat during an attack roll, if the attacker rolls a max value or the defender rolls a natural 1, the defenderâs armor loses 1 point of quality and they take an additional die of damage (of the  weaponâs type). 
If the attacker rolls a natural 1 or the defender rolls a max value, the attackerâs weapon loses 1 point of quality. 
At 0 quality, the item is destroyed. 
Each point of quality costs 10% of the itemâs cost to repair.

Outside of combat a max roll can still cause incredible success & a min roll can still invoke horrid failure both are up to the Host and group. 

## Pass at a cost
If you fail a roll you can still choose to pass at the cost of a quality point, health or something else determined by the host.

## Downtime
### Sanctuary & Healing
After a meal and rest characters roll a d8 + Fortitude and regain that.

Resting at a Sanctuary, a safe place where you have access to materials to help yourself recover and treat yourself, typically regain uses of abilities & traits unless otherwise stated.

## Advancement

Whenever a Character accumulates 1000 XP, they gain a level. As a guideline, 50 XP for low-risk accomplishments, 100 XP for moderate-risk accomplishments, 200 XP for high-risk accomplishments. The Game Master should freely notify the Characters of how much XP different objectives are worth when asked. When a Character gains a level, they roll a number of d8s equal to their new level to find their new HP maximum. If the result is less than their previous maximum, their maximum HP increases by 1. They also raise the defense and bonus scores of 3 different abilities of their choice by 1 point.
