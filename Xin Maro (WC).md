# Personality Traits

I will note the locations of valuable objects, even if theft is not the plan.
I try to speaks softly, to hide the yuan ti accent, and avoid attention.

I have grown to trust people and not any particular ideal, if they speak up there's probably something important to be heard.  

Sometimes think to save up my gains to purchase a property for myself or close ones while I am out working, to protect them from what the village or clergy might decide for them.

I see very little value in a life until I have seen more then mediocrity, that is unless we plan to cook it or sell it.

I never fully understood the cruelty the slaves were treated too.
I find the experiments & some of their forms abhorrent, while still holding great desire for the serpentine form.

# Background 

Note: The name is absolutely temporary I just can't think of one better, More detail will probably be added as needed.

> [!tldr] 
> Haunted Criminal Humanoid Trafficker who likes his people but not their cult or their upsetting acts.

Xin Maro was born into the labor class on the outskirts of the Yaun Ti empire "Mars vrael olo Chaparral" on the Day of Mars, where the new born were meant to be sacrificed to their newest deity.
However due to a raid from a human settlement they had forgotten to give him up to the alter until it was too late.

The village where Xin came from was isolated from the malisons & greater ranks of Yaun Ti governance making for a somewhat more peaceful era and a disagreement with the rest of the empire when they were forced to rejoin.

To get away from the village while also still serving the empire he took the job of a humanoid trafficker so he can spend months in the nearby human city kidnapping humanoids to send back & still be welcomed back.

The only reason he did not outright leave is that he wished to see the village and a few people there, such as Mino Calic & a few of the younger and surprisingly short newcomers to the village.

In the city he had a small party of other yaun ti, Bara Nulip a armature  alchemist, Sibyl Nomen another more intimidating rouge & a few others that would change throughout the year.
