# Parabloid Lore
Born to a scientist and a specter as the middle child, he and his siblings were used as experiments by their father, their DNA being modified and added to as an attempt to make a system breaker that can’t be beaten due to the way their original reality works resulting in Verletzen being the only survivor.

After about a decade of having his agency suppressed, his soul and as such his ability to use ki would be severely damaged as he gets saved by Mira and Towa from an experiment gone wrong which had killed his sister and left him near death.

Eventually he would start to hear voices in his mind and wonder where they’re coming from, and when he asks Mira and Towa about it and they tell him it’s very important for him to tell them everything he hears and that they’ll ensure he’ll be alright from them, with their supervision they would begin to teach him magic(perhaps even going as far as time traveling to get Babidi/Dabura to help in teaching him as well)

Over time he would make his mini-hakkero under Mira and Towa’s supervision using materials he had gathered from other timelines, while time traveling they also scout out new allies in which Verl helps ensure their loyalty by telling Mira/Towa what he hears from them, however later on Verl hears the thoughts of one of the recruits speaking about betraying them, they thanked him and as he rests, the two kill the one that planned to betray them.

Discovering his own powers, he slowly begins to realize that he’s the reason the betrayer is dead, this is where he slowly goes a bit crazy upon realizing he has been being used since the day he was saved and also finds out that this ability is the only reason they bothered to save him, he also figured out that one of the experiments he underwent is what gave him this power as he does what he was created to do and finish off their system, eventually regrowing his tail and even obtaining god ki while furthering his knowledge on magic.

Over time he would begin to explore other realities and timelines growing in power and intelligence as he does so, continuing to respawn each time he dies

# Verl’s lore

Then he spawns from his cabin in the K2 timeline only to instantly get yeeted back in time by Chevron, he would eventually be adopted by Mollie though due to absolutely refusing to wake up and wanting to starve to death, he would be forcibly converted into an Alice Droid which would involve him being tortured to death and then back to life by various different means, from there he would frequently be used as a bit of a subjugation tool by the black soul council as well as being *used* by them for other means, though one day he would wind up falling in love with someone and because of this he would end up getting scrapped.

He would then be converted into an ink fellow and be blended with his own shadow, causing him to be in near constant pain and as such caused him to avoid people like the plague and after a while the ink corruption would take notice of him and having a bit of a crush would accompany him on his wandering… acting as the closest thing he’s had to a companion in a long time in the form of a cat or a hat, as the two journeyed more and more, their bond would grow closer and closer until Verletzen would end up merging with the corruption before the k2 timeline was shattered by Luminite's royal army.


# Unschuldig Lore
Born of the King of Mostus & his wife Toriel, a royal prince by blood, and by the people's admiration & respect, trained underneath the Undying & his father, however this is not the story of the prince, but rather the entity that was left behind by Chara’s genocide, within the last moments of the prince’s life he called out to the void beyond the boundaries of his world and was answered with god like powers to give a final stand against chara.

The cost was that even though he had saved the existence of his people he had not saved his own, The Ink's corruption had consumed him and left only his mind and knowledge, given a new existence as a gore... a flower.

## That Unschuldig gore in the k2 timeline
A psychotic flower with the highest levels of intelligence among the gores, its one and only goal is to allow the corruption to feast..

The skills and knowledge of the prince have proven evergreen, allowing for the flower to act as an emissary to factions, communicate what the desertum wants and what'll happen, even to the point of delivering the corruption itself or planting the seeds of it.

Withing the gore's mind is that of the prince although with no free will of it's own the prince still fights for peace, getting the corruption to act more patiently and wait, usually to the prince's dismay at it learning more from this and building relationships of factions and notable people, the corruption is content to wait if it means the world is easier to comsume.

The gore is aware of Áfall & it's own versions across a handfull of timelines & decided to follow him, as the power of a Parabloid is priceless and the prince's engram grew to like Áfall more with the time spent, allowing for the corruption to save a significant amount of it's own size by letting him fuse into itself, the engram of the prince having been just strong enough to protect his freewill

also yes it was *using* this timeline like everyone else was, just ask any race that breaks physics by reproduction.
