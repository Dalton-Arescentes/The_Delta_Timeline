#Systema  [[Animarum]]

Hello and welcome reader to the Animarum Handbook, within are details on how to play, host or make Animarum, and hopefully a fun time.

Animarum was inspired by the games held & stories from the events from various communities such as __@ultramonke__'s zero server, @__adrenaline_junkie___’s server and the events of the souls story line in The Dwarfs Inn server, Without them and @__bluematt__, this collision of inspirations wouldn’t have been possible, other credits will be added with permission, we use discord come check us out Here, at [The Coffee Stains Center](https://discord.com/invite/hABtyvqYcb).

Using Ben Milton’s [[Knave.md]] as a base with inspiration from Open Legend's variety of stats to create a system that can be used for any setting and any game with the bonus of scaling, war gaming, investigation, reality breaking or just good old dungeon delving.
