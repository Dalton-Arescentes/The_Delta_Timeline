#### ==== Task list ====

### log
The party has decided to hunt rats to fill the 7 bone requirement given by the task board

Kou & Gease Monkey have both failed to find any rats with a perception check
Kou has brought out `#_cat` to help look
PKP-17 Has woke up to whats happening

`#_cat` problem solves instead, suggested they use the Muto Oxen's Bones instead of rats
cat questioned greaser's life expectancy
cat returned to Kou's Amberstone 

grey offers to take them to the mutoOxen 
kou agreed
greaser complained about not wanting to fight after last time, he nearly died twice when locked into a hostile slime producing room with the party 
kou's goal is now to make greaser fight

grey: ay it'll be alright, get you some armor and gear like everyone else once you've got these tasks done
grey:think there is even a coffee stand along the way

greaser was given a secret mission by Lagos to get the party to drink

kou expressed interest 
pkp asked if it was drunk like a soup
grey: I guess?
greaser corrected with "like soup"

grey starts to lead them to the mutooxen pens in the nearest agriculture chamber down the hall and into a lift to go down a few dozen floors and step out into a agriculture chamber, the grounds are padded with soil, grass and the ceiling is at least a few yards higher with some nice sunlight like illumination for the huge open chamber, they even see houses in the distance on the boarders of 6ft all metal plate fences, there is even clover flowers here and actual trees, the distant walls are still metal

greaser did not like the way the farm hand spoke

kou poked one of the black pigiment crops and stained her finger tip
kou annoyed grey
grey takes coffee break
greaser follows and brings kou along

greaser rolled a 19 on the charisma save for the hidden advertisement, + 100gp
