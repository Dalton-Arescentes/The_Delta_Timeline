*the carbon humans find themselves waking from stasis pods dropping onto the floor with one directive on their new heads up display "Survive. Thrive. And Goodluck"*

*about half of them are pumped and the others are mind numbingly pissed off*

*immediately dismantling everything and building other more useful resources*

*they find themselves in a lab and from some of the barely working systems they can tell they are a few miles underground and the exit paths are windy and annoying*

*half of them are gonna get back home.

*[[Rotu]] a very young but extremely energetic carbon is having the time of their life just Fucken taking apart a entire computer system to make some armor and start putting together a plasma charge weapon*

*half of them are still having a absolute baby fit*

*they'll be pissy the entire Fucking time*

*Rotu proceeds to kill one of the carbons to take control over the group*

*they started in a lab so their scanning instead of leaving*

*unlike what the bounty hunter had they do not get a full detailed list of how to fight them but they do learn about the only variant this lab was able to discovered known as the "Armored Freaks" these ones skin has hardened into a protective exoskeleton that has become a dark grey with spike protrusions coming off their body requiring rifle calibers to pierce*

*id suggest a short barreled rifle with burts fire over full auto. They are from adam so i assume they are smart enough to realize full auto is excessice and a way too waste ammo*

*yeah their definitely doing that, surprisingly 3 or 4 of them might be trained for this exact thing...*
