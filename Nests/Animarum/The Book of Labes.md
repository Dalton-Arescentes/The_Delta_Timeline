### Carbon Human
The Original Carbon human design by Adam Manufacturing, designed to prevent humanity from having to work in the distances of space and the harsh chemical environments of the space industrial world.

Genetically engineered from the bottom up to be more efficient, durable, and locally superior, hairless, sexless & completely loyal to the company, carbon humans don't even consume oxygen, instead producing a small amount of it instead with a type of moss living symbiotically in their lungs. 

Information on this moss has been successfully kept secure & secret by Adam Manufacturing's Legal department, all attempts to manually study the moss has shown it's incomprehensible genetic complexity, difficulty keeping it alive once removed & it's vibrant orange color.

Carbon humans are sterile, and often suffer from various medical complications, to compensate for this Adam Manufacturing installed medical access points across the body to increase the ease of maintenance, they are usually organic plastics or synthskin.

Adam Manufacturing will often heavily discount medical services for carbon humans, however there are reports of perfectly healthy carbons here and there as well, this may be to offset the nonstandard approach to gene mods Adam Manufacturing has taken & carbons being incompatible with gene mods or cybernetics meant for humans.

A few small details about Carbon Humans
The eye color of carbon humans are never  red, green or blue, not even Adam Manufacturing knows why.
The skin of a carbon human is thick & smooth, not even having hair follicles, the strange bio tech keeping them insulated from intense vacuums, but not doing them any favors against cuts and fires.
Carbons are unable to cry, it was removed to help the vacuum tests pass, their eyes can clean themselves without tears though.
Adam Manufacturing often keeps a iron clad grip on most information surrounding how carbon humans biologically function.

### Carbonic Human Type T
Every since Adam Manufacturing came out with Carbon humans there have been a number of attempts at making a better product by competing companies when it comes to this variant the primary one being Iris Security Solutions with it's focus on tech rather then industrial work in the original seemed to be focusing towards.

Created from regular human stock or from scratch they have used latest advancements in technology humanity can be augmented to be more durable, more perceptive, and more `Useful`.

With a heavy focus on making humanity more `useful` Iris Security Solutions is the leading innovator & producer of these augments and the machines to install them however getting past their screening process has only gotten more and more difficult unless you have a family tie, blackmail, or similar augments from Competing companies like Adam Manufacturing as a matter of fact Adam Manufacturing has been medically supporting any carbonic humans like carbon humans.

Adam Manufacturing's Legal Department has made it so that for all works based on or similar to carbon humans to be but under the category of carbonic humans unless the same team that made carbon humans grants them the approval of being called Carbon human.

### Cavet Ink Fellow
These unsettling people of ink from another mode of existence, though to be a creation of a mad man, their life force is entirely unknown but seems to overflow into magics and psionics and even corrupt them.

this is a weakened version of ink fellows to be compatible with D&D, the Inkwell manor & desertum are a mutual dream space for all of them, the features given here are not fully lore accurate.

Ink Fellow Creation
there are only a handful of ways that a Ink Fellow can be created.
Crafted; you were likely crafted by hand or by Mechine to look like a person or a fictional character 
Pact; You made a deal with a Entity Of Ink, this method produces unique Ink Fellows without fail, however the patron ~~might~~ does not have your best interest for your health in mind.
Corruption; You fell to the ink's corruption, became part of the goremind and somehow escaped it's control, usually by divine intervention or the goremind giving you up as part of it's grand plot. 
Genetics; You were immensely lucky and you were born into a family of your own kind, usually your family will be a combination of the previous methods

> [!Ink Fellow Traits]
> Stats; -4 con, +2 Dex
> Speed; same as your previous form or your parent's, or 30ft.
> 
> Age; Unknown, ink fellows first were discovered around the beginning the age of industry, there are no known cases of them passing away from age. 
> 
> Alignment; strongly leaning neutral, however because of the Inkwell Manor pupping it's master and controlling any ink fellows who may be useful to it's expansion of all forms of power.
> 
> Size; a Ink Fellows size is determined by the previous form or the average of their parents forms, usually medium.
>
> - Grey-Vision
> 
> You're vision is a greyscale with more shades of grey then colors most humanoids can see, if you were born to another race and suffer the corruption this trait slowly takes effect older you get, only being in full effect after a few hundred years, however on the bright side your immune to the effects of the following spells; Color spray, prismatic Spray/wall, Light & Sunbeam, and light based methods of blindness.
> 
> - Color Drain
> 
> The ink's corruption never gives up, the color drains from any and all things that stay in physical contact with your body, if the item is magical color drains from the effect that it create's before color drains from itself, mundane clothes last a few days while gradually losing color.
> 
> - Inky Constitution
>
> you don't need to eat or drink, but you do need to consume a few ounces of ink every 14 or so days, without that you will slowly dry out, similar to starvation.
> 
> Ink Influx; once a day when you consume an ounce of ink you recover 1d4+con mod (if positive) HP.
> 
> - Ink Fellow Core
> 
> around every two weeks your core will update your body, regenerating limbs, healing major wounds, and even changing your appearance to reflect your mind, extending a set of appropriate clothes from your skin and making it appear and disappear when appropriate, core reforms can be brutally violent and take anywhere from half a hour while sleeping to a dozen hours depending on your mental state and a few other things, however most people's core reforms are calm. 
> 
> Core reforms do not occur when drying out.
> 
> When your health reaches 0 you are automatically stabilized, but your body melts into spent ink with your core's tendrils retracting into itself, at your next core reform it will regenerate your body and wake you up with two levels of exhaustion.
> 
> Your core is a small 4 to 6 inch sphere with a AC of 15 & Level + d2 hp that regains 1 hp per year.
> 
> When you die your mind goes to the Inkwell manor, Your soul goes to the Desertum, and your body if strong enough to the corruption. 
> All three entitles will be unwilling to put you back together for a revive.
> 
> - Desertum Connections
> 
> Thanks to the connection to the Desertum while sleeping you can use the Inkwell Manor to Perform a modified version of Research & Training.
 
 #### Researching
 The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research.
 When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research, such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location which the manor will usually know where to start. 
 The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an investigation check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Persuasion check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.
 
 Research done in the manor if free, but you could spend your time relaxing or mentally resting instead.
 #### Training
 You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools in the manor, Your GM might allow additional training options.
 
 First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you the manor is willing to teach but it will seek to make you useful to itself later. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.

 The training lasts for 250 days. 
 After you spend the requisite amount of time and effort, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.
##### Description
The appearance of a Ink fellow can very by huge spans, from heavily serpentine, completely avian, to the mostly common human appearance with the singularly unifying trait of the lack of color, lack of internal organs and a spherical core teaming with tendrils and sometimes white patterns if they have came back from the corruption.

### WARFORGED
The mind of a Warforged has been found to have vastly different structures from the one's found in humanoids, some of them do mental expire and some don't, their bodies may be forged of steel, magic, or technology but their minds may still rot.

the variants Neo 250 and Prototype do not have composite plating.

#### Neo 250
The newest stabilized model available, apart from being newer, The Neo 250 models have additional features, such as a smoother design, fully featured hands, bizarre flexibility, and the lack of wood or natural materials in their designs.

>
> - Layer Gaps
>
> you have an internal inventory that can hold 5 lb so long as the objects are small (such as a coin bag, scroll or small trinket)
#### Prototype 99el
These are models made from wood & non-metal components to save on expenses while in the prototyping phase, A large portion of these are also simple labor models as the prototype design was good enough, their production was stopped being produced due to the demand of war and the Traditional models.
> [!Alternative Traits for prototype 99el]
> Stats; + 1 dex instead of con
> Speed; 35ft
> - Purposeful Design
> 
> you may have expertise with one skill or tool, 2 languages, 1 tool proficiency 

#### Traditional 170.2
The Classic 170 is the most common Warforged, there are various models due to different manufacture , but most of them were the result of a war. 
<sup><sup>(This is the default Warforged in the Unearthed arcana V1.4 and I won't put the stats here)

### Cavet Ordo Noxi
A race of shinny skinned, pale eyed, humanoids predating nearly all of recorded history, According to Adam Manufacturing that is.
This is a much more restricted version of the lore accurate race for the sake of playing it in d&d.

The combination of their inhuman void of compassion, & their disdain for gods has shaped the world around the younger races and factions, however their refusal to interoperate with gods led to war campaigns against them both inside and outside of Adam Manufacturing.

Example: Players need to get into a castle and a trivia point is used to ask about the Lord in hopes of using it to gain entrance into the castle.

Trivia learned: The Lord's favorite jam is apple jam.

Is this utterly useless information? Is the local orchard in need of laborers to deliver apples to the castle? Who knows?

NON-MAGICAL MATERIALS

Steel
Steel is the default metal used for weapons and armor. 
Steel is iron ore with unwanted impurities removed and other impurities introduced. 
These impurities strengthen iron, making it far more resilient.

Iron
Items made of iron weigh 1.5 times as much as the same item made from steel.
 
Iron armor 
Medium armor imposes a -1 penalty to the Dexterity modifier for calculating the 
Armor Class (AC). Heavy armor requires a
Strength score 2 points higher than that listed in the PHB. 
*Can be any Medium or Heavy armor, but not hide. 

Iron weapons 
Items without metal parts cannot be made from iron. 
An arrow could be made of iron, but a 
standard quarterstaff could not. 
(unless you wanted an iron rod, but that'd be a different weapon because then it'd be to heavy)
Iron weapons lose all Light and Finesse 
properties. 

Cost 
Armor and Weapons made from Iron cost the same as those made from steel.

Bronze 
Before the advent of iron and steel, bronze ruled the world. 
Bronze Has the Same stats as steel with the following exceptions,
Whenever a piece of ammunition hits an object the attack only does half damage.

the same as those made from steel.

Copper
Copper was the first metal to be used for 
tools, weapons and armor. 
Copper has the same stats as steel with the following exceptions

However, compared to the above metals, it is much softer and requires daily maintenance. 

Copper is non-ferrous so it doesn’t rust and it is not corroded by Rust Monsters.

stone in some way. From rocks lashed to wooden hafts to create
early maces and axes, to flint knives and stone arrowheads, these primitive weapons are still deadly. 

Stone Armor 
Armor cannot usually be constructed from stone, but advanced, often alchemically enhanced stone armor 
made by dwarves or other stone-working 
cultures does exist. 
They are one third the weight of their base
armor, and have the fragile property. 

Stone Weapons
Light and one-handed bludgeoning weapons, spears, axes, daggers, and 
arrowheads can all be made of stone. 
Weapons made of stone are one third the weight of their base weapons, and have the fragile property.

Studded leather, scale mail, breastplates, 
and wooden shields can all be constructed using bone. Bone either replaces the metal components of the armor, or in the case of wooden shields, large pieces of bone or shell replace the wood. 
They are one quarter the weight of their 
base armor, and have the fragile property. 

The armor/shield bonus of bone armor is reduced by 1. 
If the armor normally imposes disadvantage
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the bone version of the armor doesn’t. 

Bone Weapons 
Light and one-handed melee weapons, 
as well as two-handed weapons that deal 
bludgeoning damage only, can be crafted 
from bone. Hafted two-handed weapons 
such as spears can be crafted with bone tips,

and shields can all be constructed using 
wood. 
Wood replaces the metal components of the armor.

as can arrows. Other two-handed weapons cannot be constructed of wood. 
Wood weapons have the the fragile 
property. 
Wood weapons take a –1 penalty on damage
rolls (minimum 1 point damage).

(the crafting of tempered wood also requires curtain oils, 5 cp for light weapons, 1 silver for weapons, 15 cp for heavy weapons, 3 sp for light armor, 5 sp for medium armor, )

Raw Wood
this is Raw Wood, fashioned by hand with primitive tools into armor or weapons. 

Raw Wood Armor 
Studded leather, scale mail, breastplates, 
and shields can all be constructed using 
roughly worked wood. 
Wood replaces the metal components of the armor. 
They are ¼ the weight of their base armor, and have the fragile property. 
The armor bonus of Raw wood armor is 
half that listed in the PHB, except no AC 
reduction for raw wood shields. If the armor
normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the wood version of the armor doesn’t.

well as two-handed weapons that deal bludgeoning damage only, can be crafted

Mithral armor 
Can be any Medium or Heavy armor, but not hide. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate
can be worn under normal cloths. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t. 

Mithral weapons 
An item made from mithral weighs ½ as much as the same item made from other metals. Mithral is too light to be used for Heavy weapons. If the weapon isn’t Heavy, it becomes Light. If it is already listed as Light it gains the Finesse property. If the weapon is Two-Handed it is now instead Versatile. 

Mithral ammunition 
it is too light to be effective. 

Cost 
The mithral version of a suit of armor or a melee weapon costs 200 gp more than the normal version

Siron 
(found in asteroids, it looks nearly identical to iron, apart from a small sparkle & translucency in starlight)

fading magic star.
It is 1.2 times heaver then steel.

An crossbow bolt could be made with siron,
but a standard quarterstaff & arrow could not. 

Weapons forged out of siron have a 25% 
chance to deal cold damage instead of their respective type.

Siron Iron ammunition
ammunition forged out of siron have a 25% chance to deal cold damage instead of their respective type

Cost; Siron is exceptionally rare,
& is not usually shared across borders, due to this ten pounds could fetch up to a few thousand gold, it has sparked many wars

Note; Siron is a exception from the magical property

Supplementary Rules

_ _
Undocumented Instruments
 if the DM allows & it's a instrument in real life that you can prove exists, you can have proficiency with it.

Undead
The dead have no breath, & therefore can't play any wind instruments

Blood Loss (Variant Rule)
If a player losses over half their HP to a attack that causes blood loss they gain level of exhaustion if they fail a DC 14 
(Apply exhaustion after combat has finished)


DragonBorn breath attack (Varient Tweak)
Tweak; A DragonBorn's Breath attack takes 5 to 6 turns to recharge
Why; this alteration make's a DragonBorn closer to a Dragon, it would be balanced 
because it would be equivalent to a damage cantrip at lower levels.
A Dragon's breath attack takes 5 to 6 turns to recharge.
(about a minute)
A DragonBorn's breath attack takes a short or long rest to recharge 
(about a hour to 8 hours), 
without this adjustment

Combat Isolation System
Due to a council of extraordinary wizards thousands of years ago they altered the world, entering any [TYPE] combat will cause the local area to become dark & any object being interacted with be highlighted & magics will obey the magical color code 
(page 27 of coffee stains)
Anymore information is locked behind a knowledge check of the following (religion, arcana, history, nature, & Science (int) )

_ _
Barbarian Berserker Exhaustion
Tweak; allow the berserker to roll a con save before gaining a level of exhaustion, 
(exhaustion con save 10+Number of rages expended), 
failing leaves them with a level of exhaustion, but passing doesn't. 
Why; because the benefits of the rage doesn't equal the guarantee of exhaustion

Magical Color Code
If someone doesn't want to describe their spells you can color code them

**MATERIAL PROPERTIES**

The Fragile Property 

Fragile Weapons 
Fragile weapons cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can.
If you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll with a fragile weapon, you must then make a DC (14) Dexterity save
or that weapon is damaged and only does half damage after that. If already damaged, the weapon is destroyed instead.

Fragile Armor 
Armor with the fragile property falls apart when hit with heavy blows.
If you are wearing fragile armor and are hit with a critical hit, you must make a DC (14) Dexterity save or the armor is damaged and the AC bonus it provides is halved. If already damaged, the armor is destroyed instead.

Semi-Magical Property 
When inside a antimagic environment the magic properties slowly, but permanently evaporate after a few months.

Magical Property 
When inside a anti-magic environment the magic properties are suppressed after a few days, the magic slowly evaporates after a few years.

Labes magic system

Just because magic is used in charges, spell slots, sorcery points & various other things does not mean it has to be reliably quantified, when a player finds a new spell or magic item try to be vauge and let them figure out the various attributes of it.

The one exception to this is second hand magic, passed onto the followers of a powerful entity, where as the entity gets to define those things for their followers

front end, they seek expensive & exquisite jewelry to hide in, once they are hidden 
they transform into a necklace similar to the
jewelry there hidden in, once someone puts the millipede on, they gain the following benefits
proficiency & expertise with the vocal instrument & removal of negative modifiers
however the millipede tightens when they fail a vocal performance check
if the wearer takes the millipede off 
(before
it has tightened to much), the millipede will 
wait 2d4 days to be worn again, if the millipede isn't worn within this time frame, the millipede will consume a necklace that the target is wearing more often then it, the millipede will wait 1d4 more days before putting itself on the target & tighten to a point where the wearer can't remove it
just as the wearer is about to die of suffocation, the millipede reverts to its true form & rips into the wearers throat taking the vocal cords & fleeing to a safe area, the millipede will try to transform the vocal cords into another one of it's kind, there is a 60% chance of this process failing.

(0.05% chance)

The state of a being can not change here, with except to they're mind.
(A character's inventory can't change either)

VoidSpace is as close as MetaSpace as a being can get, you shouldn't find anything there, but there many things that can only be found here.

Any item that has been destroyed or removed, including items erased by Gods and wish spells

The are native beings here are copies of npcs and monsters, But they appear as silhouettes, their minds are frozen in a snapshot of they're true existence

The most powerful Gods use this place to host discussions with each other

However once a being has been here they will always be connected to it, and the void will invade through such passages

this model of PATRISHA comes equipped with an arcane dimensional compressor, allowing the interior space to be larger than the exterior. This works of the principals of a bag of holding, but adjusted to acomodate living creatures and other extra dimensional spaces within.
Arcane Fuel
this model of PATRISHA requires spell slots and other such magical fuel to run, a caster can expend a spell slot of a minimum 1st level into the fuel gage on the PATRISHA. For every 1st lv spell slot they expend this way allows the PATRISHA MK 2 "ATP" to Comfortably run for up to 8 hours at top speed without rest. if a caster expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to fuel the PATRISHA it adds another 8 hours per spell level. For example a 5th lv spell slot would allow the PATRISHA to move at maximum speeds for a maximum of 45 hours before needing to be refueled.

# Races

# Amostus Human 
> There's a race of humans called Amostus humans, named after their original homeland where they resided with another race called Dreamurs who "Mysteriously" vanished before the tuning of the industrial era.

they carry a quantum structure they control called their soul, they're literally  🤍 but with one of the Undertale soul colors, with abilities semi related to what you see in the game

> People Lore

> Inside Lore

- Naming conventions
The structure of a Amostus human's name is different in that the last name is a insult or much more commonly the last thing you'd call someone, in royals it's often the name of their family lineage, and the middle names
 
the first middle name 
take a syllable starting with a vowel
and add it to the root of your family, the family root name is often named after stars and in the case of very large families constellations, here's a list to use if you don't want to look any up, Beta, Gamma and similar are dropped in favor of adding a different inflection on the word

Antares, Sirius,Betelguese, Vega, Bellatrix, Deneb, Fomalhaut, Saiph, Velorum,Aldebaran, Denebola, Ophiuchi, Tauri, Arcuturus

A example of a Proper Amostus name would be 
William Ga-Star Dvorak 

the letters J,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z count as both vowels and consonants 

- Traits Type 1
> Age : around a even 90 years 
> Alignment : to varied
> Amostus soul
A nonmagical Heart shaped object that is the source of your Amostus abilities, it has ⅒th the amount heath as you and needs a DC 15 wisdom save to recover 1 hp at a long rest, if it is destroyed you die.
it is common sense to never to expose your soul when in danger & exposing it to starlight at least once a year so that it can heal, with some practice it can be exposed outside the body within a 5ft range

it and your eyes glows softly with the color of your subraceand gets brighter with emotions.

The structure of a Amostus Monster's name is different in that the last name is a insult or much more commonly the last thing you'd call someone, in royals it's often the name of their family lineage, and the middle names
 
the first middle name 
take a syllable starting with a Consonant and add it to the root of your family, the family root name is often named after planets and in the case of very large families Exoplanets, here's a list to use if you don't want to look any up, Beta, Gamma and similar are dropped in favor of adding a different inflection on the word

Earth, Luyten, Gliese, Kepler, Ross
