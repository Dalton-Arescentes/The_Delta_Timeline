## First Life
The [[The Hoodlum]] is born into the hellscape screaming, managed to break the skin the first time but it isn't pretty, the skin has hardened stretched and warped resembling burns from how he died.

another one, Jamal Harris who grabs onto him and scares him into the open where he sees the hellscape in all of its terror and becomes even more hysterical and panicked with the full realization that he is dead.

Jamal pulls the hoodlum back into the gash in the ground where they were born into the world and forces him down onto the ground.

*Jamal pulls the Hoodlum's face up to face him*

Ron remembered his name and stayed put, the echos of his death haunting him.

Jamal discovered a nearby Hell Noble fortress with red flesh brick construction, it's walls are decorated with the corpse of the young baphomets that used to live within.

He successfully climbed into a tower and discovered clothes & water, hell's rarest substance and helped himself to as much as he could drink.

he proceeded to lay down in a corner with the clothes & sleep, not caring for what might happen with Ron.

Ron woke up to a mini wake vile, a 7 inch tall pale humanoid and tried to determine if it was friendly by waving.

The wake vile rose it's arms in reaction and spawned orange ulfire on his chest, burning through it and into his torso killing him for the first time.

## Forth Life
The hoodlum is born from the landscape ontop of a broken pillar in a abandoned region of hell, several months have passed without anything happening.
This time his flesh had torn in a extremely good way giving him the same face he had in life.


Meanwhile Jarmal Harris is looking around the fortress and staying out of sight
he found it used to be a war fortress & is ruled by a cyber demon from hell's first wars
