 A woman runs down the street being chased by a group of thugs. She pulls out her deck of cards and quickly shuffles. She pulls the top card. The card starts to glow. She drops it on the ground. A moment later, as the thugs run over the card, the card explodes, taking the thugs out. 
 
 An adventuring party are in the middle of the forest surrounded by goblins. The Card Slinger pulls out the deck and shuffles it before pulling the top card. The card starts to glow before the Slinger throws the card. A moment later it explodes, having taken out a goblin.

### The Deck 
A Card Slinger uses a deck containing four suits <sup><i>(Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades)</i></sup> of numbered or lettered cards, each suite has 13 cards that are numbered from two to ten and lettered J, Q, K, A <sup><i> (Jack, Queen, King, Ace)</i></sup> , if a card is lost the whole deck must be replaced. 

The deck must have every suit and number in it or it will not work, so making a deck of 52 ace of spades will not work, in addition, if your deck includes Jokers, you must have them in your deck when you bond with it.

The deck is considered a ranged weapon, with a short range of 30ft and a long range of 120ft. Additionally, you start with 20 magic casings for your cards. 

Although you must always have all 54 cards on you, you can only throw cards as long as you have enough magic casings for them, casings are automatically applied <i><sup>(no action required)</i></sup> when you throw a card, whether your attack hit or misses. 

10 casings can be forged from a single set of normal playing cards <i><sup>(5sp each)</i></sup> and 1 minute of bonding the magic casings with your deck, and like arrows, you can spend 1 minute searching the battlefield to regain half your casings <i><sup>(rounded down)</i></sup> that you expended.

### Emulating a deck of cards
If you don't have a 54 card deck, you can use this dice system instead: 

To determine the card you draw, roll a d6. If you rolled a 1-4, you draw a numbered card. If you roll a 5-6, you draw a face card. To determine the specific card you draw, roll a d10. For numbered cards, each number on the d10 represents a card, aside from 1s. If you draw a face card, 2-3 is a Jack, 4-5 is a Queen, 6-7 is a King, 8-9 is an Ace, and 10 is a Joker. In either case, reroll any 1s you roll on a d10 to determine your card. If you run out of a specific type of card, such as having used every suit of 8 in a battle, reroll the dice until you land on an available card. Finally, once your card has been decided, roll a d4 to determine its suit. On the d4, a 1 is Clubs, 2 is Diamonds, 3 is Hearts, and 4 is Spades. If only three suits remain or your selected card, first remove the missing suit, and arrange the numbers according. Then, roll a d6, where a 1-2 is a 1, a 3-4 is a 2, and a 5-6 is a 3. If only two options remain, roll any dice, and assign one suit to evens and the other to odds. If an ability allows you to discard a card, use this same system to determine which card was discarded. You must choose whether to discard a card before you know what it is. Upon either drawing or discarding a card, mark it as no longer in your deck. 

It is recommended that the player keep track of how many cards they have left at any given point. Remember: There are four of every card, one for each suit, aside from the Joker card, in which there are only two copies.

### Using the deck

Shuffling and drawing a card is considered part of the action. 
You can use the choice of your Charisma modifier for these attack rolls instead of your Dexterity modifier. 

Some of your card effects require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

`Card Slinger save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Bonding with your deck
During a long rest, you must spend no less than 30 minutes taking care of your cards, this might be putting new wax on them, separating them, airing them out, and so on. 
You also must shuffle the cards at least once in order to imbue them with magic, if these things are skipped the cards will lose their magic until you complete this process, furthermore, you regain all lost cards on a long rest, resetting your deck to a standard 54 card deck.

#### Suits
