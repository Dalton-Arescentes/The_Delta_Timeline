*the lunari appear in the sky seemingly being kicked out the back of the cargo plane flying away. Inhibitors having being placed in their sternums to lower their damage output and the capacity of their muscle density they are able to use. Equipped with a knife and a backpack full of survival gear as the fall towards the ground*

.... 
*looking around and gathering information, kinda just a huge panic as these are city people, although some of them start to look at the plant life immediately having some idea*

*its not as horridly violent as the test of pandora but nothing around them is obviously dangerous the trees stretch a few hundred feet into the sky dense vegitation surrounding them*

lunari:*they're immediately gonna gather together and make shelter, sending 3 to explore out from here in a expanding curve*

*they'd find. An old bunker entrance to the west. The main city on the horizon to the north and too far to find anything else in one message currently. No freakers spotted. Some hostile wildlife tho*

*Well they're gonna avoid fighting at all costs and just stick to digging huge trenches in the woods to protect themselves as they immediately start gathering anything they can/will eat*

*lots of vegetables and fruits in the forests and many prey animals. They will not see the apocalypse for now*

*they will rotate who's on exploration and very very very very obsessively take care of the food >⁠.⁠<*

*while they are omnivorous they choose not to eat meat...
it's actually something that's a societal stigma for them, they'll eventually scavenge for resources to make tools to make their jobs easier*

*on their next exploration they find a dead guy with his chest riped open he has a gasmask over his face and a honey badger (gub) near him*

they've never seen a dead body before but take care of things

*meanwhile they're uh burning the body carefully and collecting what they can, out of the 12 only one was pragmatic enough to actually do it...* [[Peter]]

*also yes they gave adopted the squirrels they're lonely >⁠.⁠<*

THE SQUIRRELS ARE CARNIVOROUS!!!!!!!!
THEY HATE IT HERE

they lure the hoard of freakers over the edge of the bridge with the sound of a gun shot
